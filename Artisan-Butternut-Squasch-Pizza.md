## Price

£6.00

## Ingredients Dough

- 1 kg white bread flour
- 1 tsp fine sea salt
- 3 tsp dried yeast sachets
- 1 tbsp sugar
- 4 tbsp extra virgin olive oil
- 600 ml lukewarm water

## Ingredients Toppings

– 1 butternut squash
- 1 pack goats cheese
- 2 red onions
- 2 cans choped tomatos
- 2 tbsp suger
- 4 tbsp red wine vinegar
- 1 tsp fine sea salt
- ½ tsp ground pepper

## Preparation Toppings

1. Put the two cans of chopped tomatos into a pot, add 1 tsp fine sea salt, 2 tbsp suger and ½ tsp ground pepper.
2. Let it cook until the sauce is rich and thick (if you like it sweeter just add sugar).
3. Peel the butternut squash and cut it into nice thick cubes/dices and put them onto an oild baking tray — grill until gold brown and slightly burned.
5. Cut onions into half and chop them into thin slices and put them into a pan with some olive oil.
6. Let them slow cook, add suger and caramelise them and ad some red wine vinegar and let it reduce
7. Get the goats cheese ready.

## Preparation Dough

1. Sieve the flour/s and salt on to a clean work surface and make a well in the middle.
2. In a jug, mix the yeast, sugar and olive oil into the water and leave for a few minutes
3. Then pour into the well. Using a fork, bring the flour in gradually from the sides and swirl it into the liquid. Keep mixing, drawing larger amounts of flour in, and when it all starts to come together, work the rest of the flour in with your clean, flour-dusted hands.
4. Knead until you have a smooth, springy dough.
5. Place the ball of dough in a large flour-dusted bowl and flour the top of it. Cover the bowl with a damp cloth and place in a warm room for about an hour until the dough has doubled in size. 
6. Now remove the dough to a flour-dusted surface and knead it around a bit to push the air out with your hands – this is called knocking back the dough. You can either use it immediately, or keep it, wrapped in clingfilm, in the fridge (or freezer) until required.
7. If using straight away, divide the dough up into as many little balls as you want to make pizzas – this amount of dough is enough to make about six pizzas.

## Instructions

1. Preheat oven at its maximum (fan)
2. Roll out you pizza dough and put it on a round pizza tray
3. Dribble some olive oil on it (not on the edge, keep a 2 inch frame)
4. Put some tomatoe sauce on it (but not as usual, way less)
5. Get the golden butternut squash and put some cubes on it
6. Take the goats cheese and brake it in your hand into small bits above the pizza and spread it
7. Put the caramelised onions on top
8. Bake it until outer crust is gold brown
